# mapPlaces - My Google Maps JS API CRUD application demo

<h2>A little info about the project:</h2> 

<p>This application was created as a demo for a job application.</p>
<p>At first I was going to make this using Angular 5, but when I began working on this I though that a basic jQuery / Bootstrap 4 / PHP application would be enough. </p>

<p>In hindsight I could / should have used Angular, but this is the road I took so I stuck with it.</p>
<p>Overall I'm fairly satisfied with my end result, allthough I could improve this more hours and hours.</p>
<p>I did not complete all the given tasks, but the basic crud capabilities are there and it looks ok so I'm happy.</p>
